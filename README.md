# Imagenetcita

The intention is to have a small dataset that maintains the variety of images in imagenet.
The primary purpose is distillation learning ... hopefully more insights will get here ... sometime

## The name

It is named imagenetcita because the suffix -(c)ita means little in spanish,
(https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-cita#Spanish) so it conveys that it is a little imagenet dataset.

## Motivation

I wanted to have a small version of imagenet to evaluate transfer leaning approaches and figured
that an appropiate way would be to make my own dataset with the same categories but much narrower
depth (~ 10 images per class).
